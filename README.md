# T-bet+ CD8+ T cells govern anti-PD-1 responses in microsatellite-stable gastric cancers

## Abstruct
More than 90% of advanced gastric cancers (GC) are microsatellite-stable (MSS). Compared to the high response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) GCs, only 10% of unstratified MSS GCs respond to ICIs. In this study, semi-supervised learning was applied to stratify potential ICI responders in MSS GCs, achieving an area under the curve of 0.924. Spatial analysis of the TME of ICI-sensitive GCs revealed that T-bet+ CD8+ T cells were highly infiltrated in their tumor compartments. T-bet+ CD8+ T cells exhibited superior anti-tumor activity due to their increased ability to infiltrate tumors and secrete cytotoxic molecules. Adoptive transfer of T-bet+ CD8+ T cells boosted anti-tumor immunity and conferred susceptibility to ICIs in immune-ignorant MSS GCs. Spatial RNA sequencing revealed a positive-feedback loop between T-bet+ T cells and PD-L1+ tumor cells, which eventually drives T cell exhaustion and can therefore be leveraged for ICI therapy. Our research provides insights into the underlying mechanism of anti-tumor immunity and offers remedies to the long-established problem of lacking ICI responses in MSS GCs.
